#HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

them as you are doing downloading and using OpenSimMPLS now.

 - Log in to your GitHub account.
 - Look for OpenSimMPLS project.
 - Create a fork of OpenSimMPL in your own GitHub repository.
 - Clone your OpenSimMPLS repository to your PC or laptop.
 - Create a branch in your local cloned GIT repository. We recommend to name 
   this branch as "opensimmpls-yourgithubaccount" or something similar.
 - Do all modifications on this branch, file additions or deletions, 
   modifications, commits...
 - Push your modifications to your remote github OpenSimMPLS repository.
 - Go again to yout GitHub account, choose your OpenSimMPLS repository and then
   your "opensimmpls-yourgithubaccount" branch (since the previous step, this 
   branch should be there) and click on the green button at the left. This will
   guide you to make a pull request (send your modifications on your own
   OpenSimMPLS repository to OpenSimMPLS main repository from where you did your
   fork at the beginning).
 - That's all we will have your contribution and will try to merge it into the
   master branch of OpenSimMPLS. Please, comment your contribution as much as
   possible; we should undertand what you are contributing.

This is a very easy process. However, if it is very difficult to you, simply
